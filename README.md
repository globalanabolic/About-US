Established in 2006, Global Anabolic started with just one mission: to bring the chemically purest anabolic medicine to the world.

We manufacture various Anabolic, Human Growth Hormone and ancillary pharmaceuticals to be administered through oral and injectable delivery systems.

Global Anabolic has enjoyed significant global growth over the past nine years by strategically aligning with well-established distributors throughout Asia and beyond.

With global headquarters based in Hong Kong, we at Global Anabolic are committed to delivering top quality pharmaceutical-grade products that have become synonymous with our brand and reputation. We are continuously focusing on improving both the standard of our product and our business.

Our products are manufactured in our Current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility to ensure optimal quality. Global Anabolic also complies with ISO 9001 regulations to ensure that all facets of our operations adhere to the highest quality standards.

We use only quality raw material manufactured to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or British Pharmacopeia (BP) standards. From procurement of raw materials to packaging of finished product, our quality control team oversees every step of the manufacturing process to deliver some of the purest quality pharmaceutical-grade products available today.
